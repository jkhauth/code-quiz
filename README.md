    <!--GAME OVER SCREEN-->
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p> The application then delivers the game over screen. This project was the first one were I found myself really frustrated and the time was very short from when we learned. I got all of the functionality working, it just doesnt look that great. I wasn't very happy with this application on what I produced.</p>
